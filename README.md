This is the main repository for the Database Design &amp; Management: Drug Stock of a Government Hospital project.

Hey Visitor!

Drishti here.
I've created this repository to add documents and other related files for the Database Design &amp; Management: Drug Stock of a Government Hospital project.

The project is based on research I did through a voice call interview of the Pharmacist of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, District Hospital, Gorakhpur, U.P. In order to remove all the limitations faced by many government hospitals in India which still use the flat file(manual) method for management of drug stock, database approach is used which is able to optimally store and retrieve data.
Research documents have been added. Survey file contains the record of the voice call interview of the Pharmacist of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, District Hospital, Gorakhpur, U.P. and the Official formats of manual registers file (image) contains the format of the registers maintained in Government Hospitals provided by the said Pharmacist.

Project Files and Documents have been added.
Database Design & Management_ Drug Stock of a Government Hospital.pdf contains the complete documentation of the project including Problem Statement which includes need, facts and requirements and assumptions, Analysis, ER Diagram, Relational Schema, Relational Model in sqlplus and References.
Presentation_Database Design & Management_ Drug Stock of a Government Hospital.pptx contains the project presentation.
Code_Relational Model_sqlplus.txt contains the code of the Relational Model in sqlplus.

The project ends here.

This project is a combination of design and implementation of a database management system for management of drug stock of a government hospital.  This project is designed exclusively for Government Hospitals' drug stock management and not for Private Hospitals' because of the difference in the nature of their structures like only drugs' chemical name is available in the database for Government Hospitals and record of brand name of the drugs is not maintained unlike Private Hospitals, etc.
